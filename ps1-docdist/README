The tarball just unzipped contains the following:

docdist7.py: a file very much like docdist6.py, but with vector_angle
and inner_product left unimplemented.

ps1.py: contains the old versions of vector_angle and
inner_product. After modifying these, you should submit this file to
the class website.

test-ps1.py: has unittests that will test for the new correct answers.

t1.verne.txt, t2.bobsey.txt, t8.shakespeare.txt, t9.bacon.txt: data
files containing text used in the unit tests.
