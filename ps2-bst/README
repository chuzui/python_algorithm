This tarball contained the following:

bst.py: basic BST implementation, including insert and find methods.

bstsize.py: subclass of bst.py that augments the BST with the size of each node's subtree

bstrank.py: adds a rank function to bstsize.py. This file is NOT needed for the problem set, but it may serve as a useful example.

bstselect.py: Stub to be filled in and submitted online.

test-bst.py: Run this unittest file to see if bstselect.py is correct.
